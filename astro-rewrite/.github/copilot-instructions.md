# Astro Project - React to Astro Conversion

This is an Astro project converted from a React application. The project includes:

- **Framework**: Astro with TypeScript support
- **Styling**: CSS
- **Internationalization**: i18n support
- **Architecture**: Multi-page application with components, layouts, and pages
- **Content**: Static content loaded from JSON files
- **Features**: Search functionality, multi-language support, responsive design

## Project Structure
- `src/pages/` - Astro pages (file-based routing)
- `src/components/` - Reusable Astro components
- `src/layouts/` - Page layouts
- `src/styles/` - CSS stylesheets
- `src/data/` - JSON data files
- `public/` - Static assets

## Development Guidelines
- Use Astro components (.astro files) for UI components
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration for interactive components
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Astro's file-based routing conventions
- Implement i18n using Astro's built-in internationalization features
